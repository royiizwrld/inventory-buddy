## Architecture
- All inventory data lives in localStorage via `src/context/InventoryContext.tsx`; status/summary logic is pure in `src/lib/inventory.ts` — keeps storage swappable and logic testable.
- AI calls run only server-side: extraction in `src/lib/ai.functions.ts` (server fn), streaming chat in `src/routes/api/chat.ts` — keeps the key out of the browser.
- Assistant suggested changes come as a fenced `actions` JSON block and are applied only after user confirmation.
- Camera decoding uses a dynamically imported ZXing reader in an effect, with explicit stream cleanup — keeps browser camera access out of SSR and releases the camera when scanning ends.
- Scanned identifiers use exact matching in `src/lib/scanning.ts`; shared codes require explicit item selection before restocking — prevents stock being added to the wrong item.
- Color presets override semantic CSS tokens through a root data attribute, independently of light/dark mode — preserves component theming and existing inventory storage.
- Include lazy camera and tab dependencies in Vite's initial optimization list — prevents late dependency rebuilds from mixing React module versions in an open preview.
- Asset tracking fields are optional on the shared item type — older local inventory records and existing imports remain compatible.
- Reorder and warranty calculations are pure helpers in `asset-planning.ts`; PDFs are generated on demand in the browser — keeps planning testable and inventory documents private to the device.
- Display currency is a device setting in `src/lib/currency.ts`; amounts are labelled, never converted, and the shell remounts page content when it changes — keeps all money formatting in one helper.
- Exchange rates come from a free keyless public API in `src/lib/exchange-rates.ts`, cached per base currency for 24h with stale fallback — prices are converted once at entry and stored in the app currency.
